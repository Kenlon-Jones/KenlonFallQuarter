7. What are zoning laws? Take the location you chose in question 4. Research and find one zoning law that applies to the type of your business idea.
Zoning laws are local government regulations that divide a municipality into zones to control land use and the characteristics of development, such as building height, density, and purpose (residential, commercial, or industrial). Zoning laws for bike repair shops vary by location but are generally allowed in commercial or light industrial zones and may require a permit or conditional use permit, while home-based businesses are allowed in residential zones under certain conditions, such as being small and non-disruptive. To determine the specific requirements, you must check your local city or county's zoning ordinances, which often detail permissible uses, permit processes, and site-specific regulations.
